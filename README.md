# 👋 Hello, I'm Nipun Fernando

🎓 I'm an undergraduate at **APIIT Sri Lanka**, currently pursuing a **BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering**.

🚀 I co-founded [**Hustlers Media**](https://hustlersmedia.com/), a freelance **web design agency** established in 2022 — and we've been helping brands build clean, modern digital experiences ever since.

📱 More recently, I've developed a strong passion for **mobile application development**, which led me to pursue this degree. I'm especially interested in creating cross-platform mobile apps using **Flutter** and continuing to grow as a full-stack mobile developer.

🧑‍💻 **Currently in**:  
Year 2, Semester 1 of my 3-year degree program.
